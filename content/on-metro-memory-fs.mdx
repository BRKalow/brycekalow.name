If you've done your share of testing Node, you've probably found yourself wanting to mock the file-system, particularly the `fs` core module. I've had mixed success with this historically; generally it becomes an exercise in GitHub Issue and StackOverflow spelunking.

In my last foray, I stumbled upon [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3154). After reading through it I found that someone suggested the in-memory `fs` used by the [React Native bundler Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) for its automated tests. As luck would have it, that module is already published as [`metro-memory-fs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metro-memory-fs). Sweet!

## Getting Started With `metro-memory-fs`

There's not much documentation for `metro-memory-fs` (read: none ðŸ˜…), but fortunately it's pretty straightforward! I'm going to assume that you are using `jest` to write your unit tests from here on out.

We can start by installing it:

```bash
$ yarn add --dev metro-memory-fs

# or if you use npm

$ npm install --save-dev metro-memory-fs
```

In your tests, you can initialize the mock like this:

```js
jest.mock("fs", () => new (require("metro-memory-fs"))());

// if you want to reset the mock before each test case:
beforeEach(() => require("fs").reset());
```

Now that we're setup we can start acting against our mocked `fs` instance.

### _Note: `cwd` configuration_

If you encounter an error similar to this:

```js
The path /some/path/to/file.txt cannot be resolved because no
current working directory function has been specified. Set the
`cwd` option field to specify a current working directory.
```

Then you might have to configure the `cwd` option like this:

```js
jest.mock("fs", () => new (require("metro-memory-fs"))({ cwd: () => "/" }));
```

This was enough for me to fix the issue and continue writing my tests.

## Writing Tests

Let's assume that we've got a function which writes to a file called `test.txt`. Problem is, we don't want to have to manually delete the file after our tests are done. Which is probably why we stumbled on this article... ðŸ¤”. Now that we've got our mock setup with `metro-memory-fs` this should be easy!

Here's our test setup:

```js
import fs from "fs";
import writeTestFile from "../write-test-file";

jest.mock("fs", () => new (require("metro-memory-fs"))({ cwd: () => "/" }));

beforeEach(() => require("fs").reset());

describe("writeTestFile", () => {});
```

Alright, looking good. Let's add a test case...

```js
import fs from "fs";
import writeTestFile from "../write-test-file";

jest.mock("fs", () => new (require("metro-memory-fs"))({ cwd: () => "/" }));

beforeEach(() => require("fs").reset());

describe("writeTestFile", () => {
  test("writes to test.txt", async () => {
    // invoke our function, writing to /test.txt
    await writeTestFile("/");

    // read our written file to validate its contents
    const result = await fs.promises.readFile("test.txt");
    expect(result).toEqual("test");
  });
});
```

That's it! By mocking `fs` with `metro-memory-fs` we are able to write tests against the file-system with minimal ceremony. ðŸŽ‰

## Reducing Boilerplate

If you anticipate having to lean on `metro-memory-fs` for many of your tests you could specify the mock in one of your [`setupFiles`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#setupfiles-array), or create an importable helper like this:

```js
// mock-fs.js
jest.mock("fs", () => new (require("metro-memory-fs"))({ cwd: () => "/" }));
beforeEach(() => require("fs").reset());

// in a test file:
import "./utils/mock-fs";
```

## That's A Wrap

Mocking `fs` doesn't have to be hard, I'm pretty glad I stumbled upon `metro-memory-fs`. Hopefully this post can serve as simple documentation for the package and save you a few minutes if you decide to implement `metro-memory-fs` in your own project! I'll do my best to update this post where necessary as I continue to take advantage of the package in my own test suites.

## Credits

- The package itself ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/metro-memory-fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/metro-memory-fs))
- The issue I linked above was what initially pointed me towards `metro-memory-fs` and provided the mocking setup ([https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3154](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3154))
- The test files for `metro-memory-fs` were really helpful for understanding how to use the module ([https://github.com/facebook/metro/blob/master/packages/metro-memory-fs/src/\_\_tests\_\_/index-test.js](https://github.com/facebook/metro/blob/master/packages/metro-memory-fs/src/__tests__/index-test.js))
