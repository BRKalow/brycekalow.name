So, you need to iterate over something in JavaScript. You know about `.forEach()` and `.map()`, but you wonder why you don't see much of the "traditional" for loop anymore. You've done some searching and come across `for ... of` and `for ... in`.  What's the difference?

## Example

Here's what `for ... of` looks like:

```jsx
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];

for (const element of myArray) {
  console.log(element);
}

// what do we get?
```

Here's what `for ... in` looks like:

```jsx
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];

for (const element in myArray) {
  console.log(element);
}

// what do we get?
```

Immediately the operators seem to be accomplishing a similar task, but the devil's in the details; we dig deeper.

Let's try executing these snippets, here's what we'll get for the first:

```jsx
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];

for (const element of myArray) {
  console.log(element);
}

// what do we get?

// 1
// 2
// 3
```

Alright, cool. So it looks like we are just iterating over the elements in the array. That's to be expected, right? What about `for ... in`?

```jsx
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];

for (const element in myArray) {
  console.log(element);
}

// what do we get?

// 0
// 1
// 2

// 🤔
```

Okay, that's maybe not quite what we expected. An astute observer can see that we are actually iterating over the indices of `myArray`, but why?

## MDN To The Rescue

When  faced with a JavaScript question (as one often is), I find myself turning to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/). MDN is an awesome resource for all things web development and JavaScript, so let's head there and dive into the difference between these two iteration strategies.

First, `for ... of`: 

> The **for...of statement** creates a loop iterating over iterable objects ...   It invokes a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property of the object. ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of))

This gives us a hint: "...statements to be executed for the **value** of each distinct property of the object." Huh, so we get each value in the iterable. So what does `for ... in` give us? Let's find out...

> The **for...in statement** iterates over all non-Symbol, enumerable properties of an object. ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in))

Short, sweet. `for ... in` gives us all of the **properties** of an iterable. Mystery solved!

## Mystery Solved?

Wait a minute, what are the properties of an array? We know what an object's properties are:

```jsx
const myObject = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3
};

// My properties are: 'a', 'b', 'c' 👍
```

What about an array though? When we used `for ... in` on `myArray` we got the indices.   Have you heard the old saying "everything in JavaScript is an object?" Well, in this case it's true! An `Array` is just a special type of object in JavaScript who's properties are indices to a value. We can think of `myArray` as looking something like this:

```jsx
const myArray = {
  0: 1,
  1: 2,
  2: 3
};

// My properties are: 0, 1, 2 ✨
```

Of course, there's [more to Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) than just that, but this at least let's us understand where the results from `for ... in` are coming from. Sometimes taking a peak underneath the hood gives us a better understanding for why things work.

## That's A Wrap

So, now we can confidently say:

- `for ... of` **gives us values of an iterable**
- `for ... in` **gives us properties of an iterable**

Sometimes the simplest things can provide excellent learning opportunities and give us a chance to get a better grasp on the way things work. Never stop exploring!
